# ESPwirelessToyCar
A simple project to have a WIFI-controlled ESP8266 toycar

The project builds upon the AP and WiFiServer examples included in the ESP8266WiFi and WEMOS_Motor libraries
to provide a simple framework where HTTP requests function as commands to a toycar.  
This allows any device with WiFi capabilities to connect to the ESP generated wireless network to send commands through
any applications capable of sending HTTP requests.  
An implementation as an android app will follow.
